abstract = "Assessing the impact of changes in a production network (e.g., new routing protocols or topologies) requires simulation or emulation tools capable of providing results as close as possible to those from a real-world experiment. Large traffic loads and complex control- data plane interactions constitute significant challenges to these tools. To meet these challenges we propose a model for the fast and convenient evaluation of SDN as well as legacy networks. Our approach emulates the networkâ€™s control plane and simulates the data plane, to achieve high fidelity necessary for control plane behavior, while being capable of handling large traffic loads. We design and implement a proof of concept from the proposed model. The initial results of the prototype, compared to a state-of-the-art solution, shows it can increase the speed of network experiments by nearly 95% in the largest tested network scenario."
