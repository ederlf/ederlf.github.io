# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "While the clean slate approach proposed by Software Defined Networking (SDN) promises radical changes in the stagnant state of network management, SDN innovation has not gone beyond the intra-domain level. For the inter-domain ecosystem to benefit from the advantages of SDN, Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are the ideal place: a central interconnection hub through which a large share of the Internet can be affected. In this demo, we showcase the ENDEAVOUR platform: a new software defined exchange approach readily deployable in commercial IXPs. We demonstrate here our implementations of traffic engineering and Distributed Denial of Service mitigation, as well as how member networks cash in on the advanced SDN-features of ENDEAVOUR, typically not available in legacy networks."
