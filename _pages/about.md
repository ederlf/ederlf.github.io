A former hands-on researcher networked systems with a PhD on Computer Science. I worked quite a lot on building stuff for Software Defined Networking research such as [RouteFlow](https://routeflow.github.io/RouteFlow/), [OpenFlow software switches](https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13) and [simulators](https://github.com/ederlf/horse) and [SDN Internet Exchange Points](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dd1cuxl9t0yb8mm/Design-of-scalable-SDN-IXPs-fabrics.pdf?dl=0).

Nowadays I am helping Platform.sh's core engineering team to try building the best Platform as a Service solution. Containers, Python, Go and much more. You can check a bit more about what I've been doing on my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/81ux6a7q0ynf8hvtbke6t/EderLeaoMoosmannResume.pdf?rlkey=yh2cpdf5x4ywzl3lfkiee0hvw&st=xcn25lbk&dl=0).
