A former hands-on researcher networked systems with a PhD on Computer Science. I worked quite a lot on building stuff for Software Defined Networking research such as [RouteFlow](https://routeflow.github.io/RouteFlow/), [OpenFlow software switches](https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13) and [simulators](https://github.com/ederlf/horse) and [SDN Internet Exchange Points](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dd1cuxl9t0yb8mm/Design-of-scalable-SDN-IXPs-fabrics.pdf?dl=0).

Despite all the time working with networks research I do consider myself a generalist. Nowadays I am adventuring in the industry as an Engineering Manager.

Curious mind, asks lots of questions.
