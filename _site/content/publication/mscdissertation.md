abstract = "OpenFlow is the most prominent technology to enable Software Defined Networking. Designed as control interface between switches and controllers, the protocol can be considered an instruction set to program the network forwarding logic. The first OpenFlow version attracted attention from both the industry and academy researchers interested in SDN promised benefits. Quickly, a tool set for OpenFlow 1.0 was available, which included switches, controllers, test and emulation software. When the protocol standardization process started by the Open Network Foundation, OpenFlow evolved fast and new specifications emerged in the last years. New features empowered the protocol and created enthusiasm, however projects of experimentation tools did not followed the OpenFlow fast pace. This work addresses one of these gaps, implementing an experimenter friendly OpenFlow 1.3 software switch. Driven by simplicity and basic performance requirements, the tool purpose is to be a functional and easy option for SDN developers that want to take advantage of the benefits brought by more recent OpenFlow versions. Overall, this project resulted in the open source release of the first OpenFlow 1.3 switch, allowing researchers from all around the globe to prototype and demonstrate solutions impossible in a prior moment."
